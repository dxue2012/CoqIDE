This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4388

You can use this script to make vim behaves like CoqIDE.

This script needs +perl vim option.

Should work well on non-gui version of vim on unix systems.

See comments at beginning of coq_IDE.vim for more informations.

Note that the command to enable key bindings in .vimrc is:

let g:CoqIDEDefaultMap
